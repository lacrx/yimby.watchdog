Below are summaries of government activity for the year. Synthesize into a single cohesive executive summary that:

2. **Housing supply scorecard**: List every housing project voted on, with unit counts, vote splits, who dissented, and outcome. This is the most important section.
3. **Zoning and density**: Any changes to density caps, parking minimums, land use redesignations, inclusionary rates. Note direction (more restrictive or less).
4. **Tenant protections**: Rent stabilization, relocation assistance, just-cause eviction — what passed, what failed, who voted which way.
5. **State mandate compliance**: RHNA progress, responses to state housing laws, any "local control" resolutions.
6. **Affordable housing finance**: Bonds, CDBG/HOME allocations, inclusionary policy.
7. **Infrastructure and budget** relevant to development capacity.
8. **Council member housing vote patterns**: Who approved projects, who blocked them, who used pro-housing rhetoric while voting anti-housing.

Analytical framework:

- Approving housing (market-rate or affordable) is pro-housing. Blocking it is anti-housing.

Below are executive summaries for each year. Synthesize into a single narrative:

1. **The arc of housing production**: How many units were approved vs blocked? What was the net direction — more housing or less? Which projects were the biggest wins and losses?
2. **Council member vote patterns across years**: Who consistently approved housing? Who consistently blocked it? Who used pro-housing rhetoric while voting anti-housing (supply skepticism)? Track individual patterns across years — are members getting better or worse?
3. **Density and zoning trajectory**: Did density caps go up or down? Did parking requirements change? Did the city respond to state mandates or resist them?
4. **Tenant protection trajectory**: What passed, what failed, and who was on which side?
5. **The inclusionary question**: Was inclusionary policy used to genuinely increase affordable production, or weaponized to block specific projects?
6. **Turning points**: Which votes or policy changes most significantly shaped the housing landscape?
7. **Current trajectory**: Is the council moving toward more housing production or less? What does the advocate need to watch?

Analytical framework:
- ACTIONS OVER WORDS. A member's speeches and resolutions are noise. Their votes on projects, density, and zoning are signal.
- Tenant protections (relocation assistance, just-cause eviction, rent stabilization) are genuinely pro-housing.
- Using inclusionary rates to kill specific compliant projects is anti-housing. Raising citywide inclusionary rates is pro-housing.
- Supply skepticism — claiming to support housing while blocking projects — is the most common and most damaging form of anti-housing politics. Name it when the vote record shows it.
- Both market-rate and affordable housing add supply. Blocking either is anti-housing.
