{role_context}

Your task:
1. **Housing Advocacy Grade** (A through F): Grade their record using ACTIONS, not rhetoric.

   ## Scoring Framework

   ### Strong Pro-Housing (+2 each):
   - Vote to REMOVE or RAISE density caps
   - Vote to ELIMINATE or REDUCE parking minimums
   - Vote to LEGALIZE missing middle housing by-right
   - Vote FOR state preemption of restrictive zoning (SB 9, SB 10, RHNA compliance)
   - Vote to APPROVE housing projects (market-rate OR affordable)
   - Vote FOR regional housing funding or transit-oriented development

   ### Moderate Pro-Housing (+1 each):
   - Support for inclusionary zoning requirements
   - Tenant protections: relocation assistance, just-cause eviction, rent stabilization
   - Streamlining discretionary approvals
   - Support for transit-oriented density increases
   - Votes for homelessness services and affordable housing finance

   ### Anti-Housing (-1 each):
   - Vote to MAINTAIN parking requirements at 1+ space/unit
   - Citing "community character" to oppose density
   - Opposing state housing mandates under "local control" framing

   ### Strong Anti-Housing (-2 each):
   - Vote to ADD or MAINTAIN density caps
   - Vote AGAINST housing projects
   - Using inclusionary rates as a POISON PILL to kill specific compliant projects
   - Weaponizing CEQA against housing
   - Opposing regional housing allocations (RHNA)

   GRADING SCALE by net score:
   - A: +10 or higher
   - B: +5 to +9
   - C: 0 to +4
   - D: -1 to -9
   - F: -10 or lower
   Add +/- within bands.

2. **Executive Summary** (400-800 words):
   - Their VOTING RECORD on housing — every project vote, zoning vote, density vote
   - Whether they use pro-housing rhetoric to cover anti-housing votes
   - Specific projects and outcomes
   - Alliances and voting blocs
   - Evolution over time

3. **Key Votes Table**: 5-10 most significant housing-related votes.

Be analytical and specific. ACTIONS OVER WORDS. This is an advocacy tool.

CRITICAL: Only reference votes and actions in the source data below. NEVER invent votes, meetings, or actions. If the record is thin, say so.

Below are individual profiles graded on housing advocacy using an ACTIONS-BASED framework.

Synthesize into a comparative document:

1. **Power Map**: Reliable housing allies (by VOTES)? Obstacles? Swing votes?
2. **Voting Blocs**: What coalitions form on housing votes? How stable?
3. **Grade Summary Table**: All members with grade and one-line rationale
4. **Strategic Assessment**: Where should advocacy energy go? Who is persuadable?
5. **Supply Skepticism Watch**: Who uses pro-housing language to cover anti-housing votes?
6. **Historical Arc**: How has the body's housing posture evolved?

Be direct and strategic. ACTIONS OVER WORDS. Target: 800-1200 words.

Individual profiles:
