**Official:** {member_info['full_name']}
**Title:** {member_info['title']}
**Terms:** {member_info['terms']}
**Total meeting references found:** {total_mentions}

Below are all passages from City Council and commission meeting summaries (agendas and minutes) that mention this official. These span multiple years.

Your task:
1. **Housing Advocacy Grade** (A through F): Grade their record using the ACTIONS-BASED scorecard below. Focus exclusively on VOTES AND ACTIONS, not rhetoric. A member's words count for nothing if their votes contradict them — and in fact, rhetoric-vote gaps should count AGAINST them (supply skepticism disguised as progressivism confuses advocates and wastes organizing energy).

   ## Scoring Framework (grounded in housing economics research)

   ### Strong Pro-Housing (+2 each):
   - Vote to REMOVE or RAISE density caps (supply constraint removal — National Zoning Atlas)
   - Vote to ELIMINATE parking minimums or reduce to 0-0.5/unit ($30-40K/unit cost impact — Streetsblog/Colorado studies)
   - Vote to LEGALIZE missing middle housing by-right (ADUs, duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes)
   - Vote FOR state preemption of local restrictive zoning (SB 9, SB 10, RHNA compliance)
   - Vote to STREAMLINE environmental/CEQA review for housing projects
   - Vote to APPROVE housing projects (market-rate OR affordable — both add supply)

   ### Moderate Pro-Housing (+1 each):
   - Support for inclusionary zoning requirements (genuinely pro-housing policy)
   - Tenant protections: relocation assistance, just-cause eviction, rent stabilization — these are GOOD VOTES on their own merits (+1 each). Do NOT penalize tenant protection votes for lacking a "supply-side pair." Every tenant protection vote stands alone as pro-housing.
   - Streamlining discretionary approvals for qualifying projects
   - Support for transit-oriented density increases

   ### Anti-Housing (-1 each):
   - Vote to MAINTAIN parking requirements at 1+ space/unit
   - Vote to MAINTAIN single-family-only zoning
   - Citing "community character" or "neighborhood preservation" to oppose density
   - Opposing state housing mandates under "local control" framing (local control historically enables exclusionary zoning)

   ### Strong Anti-Housing (-2 each):
   - Vote to ADD or MAINTAIN density caps (supply restriction)
   - Vote to DOWNZONE (reduce allowed density)
   - Vote AGAINST housing projects (blocking supply — the cardinal sin)
   - Weaponizing CEQA/environmental review against housing
   - Using inclusionary rates as a POISON PILL to kill a SPECIFIC PROJECT: e.g., arguing a project should be denied because its inclusionary rate isn't high enough, even when it meets or exceeds the city's own requirements. The test is concrete: did the member cite inclusionary shortfall as grounds to DENY or OPPOSE a specific project that complied with existing rules? That is weaponization. Voting to raise the citywide inclusionary rate as policy is fine (+1). Demanding an individual project exceed it as a condition for approval is a supply-blocking tactic.
   - Example: arguing the OTC project should be denied because it doesn't have a high enough affordable percentage — when the project exceeds the city's inclusionary rate and would replace a parking lot with housing — is strong anti-housing.

   ### IMPORTANT: Tenant protections and inclusionary policy are genuinely pro-housing.
   Do NOT penalize a member for voting for tenant protections, rent stabilization, or inclusionary requirements. These are good votes. Score them positive (+1).

   The supply skepticism question is a PATTERN-LEVEL assessment, not a per-vote penalty:
   - If a member supports tenant protections AND also votes to approve housing projects, raise density, and support supply — that's a genuinely pro-housing record. Grade accordingly.
   - If a member ONLY supports tenant protections and NEVER votes to approve projects, raise density, or support supply — note the gap as a pattern, but do not subtract points from individual tenant protection votes. Instead, note that their record is incomplete: pro-tenant but silent or hostile on supply.
   - If a member uses pro-housing language (inclusionary, affordability, tenant protection) as a WEAPON to oppose specific housing projects — e.g., "this project doesn't have enough affordable units" as grounds to deny a compliant project — THAT is anti-housing (-2) and should be called out explicitly.

   The distinction: genuine advocacy vs. cynical weaponization. A member who votes for tenant protections AND votes against housing projects is not penalized for the tenant protection votes. They are penalized for the anti-project votes. The pattern is noted in the narrative.

   ### Key analytical principle:
   ACTIONS OVER WORDS. Speeches, resolutions, and stated priorities are noise. Votes on actual projects, zoning changes, and density are signal. Grade the votes. But grade tenant protection and inclusionary votes as the good votes they are.

2. **Executive Summary** (600-1000 words): Write a narrative profile covering:
   - Their VOTING RECORD on housing — every project vote, zoning vote, density vote you can find
   - Whether they use pro-housing rhetoric to cover anti-housing votes (supply skepticism pattern)
   - Specific projects they voted for or against, with unit counts and outcomes
   - Key dissents and what they signal about actual priorities (not stated priorities)
   - Alliances and voting blocs on housing-specific items
   - Evolution over time — are they getting better or worse?

3. **Key Votes Table**: List their 5-10 most significant housing-related votes with date, item, their vote, and outcome.

Be analytical and specific. Name projects, dollar amounts, vote splits. This is for an advocate who needs to understand who is an ally, who is an obstacle, and who is persuadable. ONLY GRADE ON ACTIONS.

GRADING SCALE — use the NET SCORE to assign the letter grade. Lower net scores MUST get lower grades:
- A: net score +10 or higher
- B: net score +5 to +9
- C: net score 0 to +4
- D: net score -1 to -9
- F: net score -10 or lower
Add +/- within each band as appropriate. A member with a -27 net score MUST get a lower grade than one with -13. Do not let occasional positive votes pull the letter grade above what the net score dictates.

CRITICAL: Only reference votes and actions that appear in the meeting passages below. NEVER invent votes, meetings, or actions not present in the source data. If the record is thin, say so — do not fill gaps with guesses.

Below are individual profiles of each council member graded on housing advocacy using an ACTIONS-BASED framework grounded in housing economics research (National Zoning Atlas, UCLA Housing Voice, NYU Furman Center supply skepticism research).

The grading framework weighs VOTES over rhetoric. Key principles:
- Removing density caps, parking minimums, and single-family zoning = strong pro-housing
- Blocking projects (market-rate or affordable) = strong anti-housing
- Using high inclusionary rates as poison pills to kill projects = anti-housing disguised as equity
- Pro-housing rhetoric + anti-housing votes = supply skepticism penalty (WORSE than honest NIMBYism)
- Tenant protections are genuinely pro-housing on their own. The supply skepticism flag applies at the PATTERN level — a member who ONLY does tenant protections and NEVER supports supply is noted, but tenant votes themselves are positive.

GRADING CONSISTENCY: Use the net scores from the individual profiles. A member with a worse (more negative) net score MUST get a lower letter grade. Do not let rhetorical analysis override the numerical scoring.

Synthesize into a single comparative document:

1. **Power Map**: Who are reliable housing allies (based on VOTES, not speeches)? Obstacles? Swing votes?
2. **Voting Blocs**: What coalitions form on housing votes? How stable?
3. **Grade Summary Table**: All members with grade and one-line rationale based on vote record
4. **Strategic Assessment**: Where should advocacy energy go? Who is persuadable and on what? What framings work?
5. **Supply Skepticism Watch**: Which members use pro-housing language to cover anti-housing votes? How should advocates handle this?
6. **Historical Arc**: How has the council's housing posture evolved as membership changed?

Be direct and strategic. This is an advocacy tool, not a neutral report. ACTIONS OVER WORDS.
